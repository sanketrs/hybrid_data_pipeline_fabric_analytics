# Hybrid Data Pipeline Architecture with Microsoft Fabric, Azure, and Power BI

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the **Hybrid Data Pipeline Architecture** repository. This project demonstrates how to build a **scalable, efficient, and hybrid data pipeline** using **Microsoft Fabric**, **Azure Cloud services**, and **Power BI**. By integrating **on-premise ecosystems** with the **cloud**, this architecture enables seamless data ingestion, transformation, and analytics. The pipeline follows a structured **Bronze-Silver-Gold data model** to ensure high-quality data readiness for advanced analytics and business reporting.

## **Why This Architecture Matters**

In todayâ€™s data-driven world, organizations must manage and process vast amounts of data from diverse sources like IoT devices, financial transactions, weather systems, and business applications. This hybrid architecture offers:
- **End-to-End Data Automation**: From ingestion to analytics.
- **Scalable Data Management**: Handles growing datasets efficiently.
- **Real-Time Insights**: Delivers actionable insights through **Power BI dashboards**.
- **Cost Optimization**: Uses **Parquet format** and cloud-native tools to minimize costs.

This repository is perfect for businesses, data engineers, and analysts looking to modernize their data pipelines and adopt cloud-driven analytics.

## **Architecture Overview**

This architecture bridges on-premise systems with cloud-based analytics to provide an **end-to-end data processing pipeline**. The system follows a layered structure:
1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw, unprocessed data.
2. **Silver Layer**: Contains cleaned and validated data.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses enriched and analytics-ready datasets.
